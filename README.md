# Text-classification-with-BERT-model-
Text classification problem determined whether the messages is spam or not.

This approach we have used a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to gain our model. 

We have used a simple neural network with pretrained BERT model. We achieved an accuracy on the test set equal to 97 % and it is a very good result

Model :- NN + BERT
Accuracy :- 0.973

#### The Project is created with :-
- Python 3.8.3
- libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow,tensorflow_hub,tensorflow_text.
